# Build Scripts

This directory contains the scripts that travis uses to build the project.

Tests on the entire [`narrowspark/http-status`](https://github.com/narrowspark/http-status) repository,
and then sends code coverage reports out to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/github/narrowspark/http-status).
